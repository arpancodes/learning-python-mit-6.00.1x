'''
A clever mathematical trick (due to Euclid) makes it easy to find greatest common divisors. Suppose that a and b are two positive integers:

If b = 0, then the answer is a

Otherwise, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(b, a % b)
'''


def gcdRecur(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers

    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcdRecur(b, a % b)


print(gcdRecur(2, 12))
print(gcdRecur(6, 12))
print(gcdRecur(3, 12))
print(gcdRecur(17, 12))
